## Overview

The program implements two algorithms for calculating the distance of
a classical linear binary code or a quantum CSS qubit code:

- Random information set (also, random window, or `RW`), to calculate
  the upper distance bound, and
- Connected cluster (`CC`), to calculate the actual distance or lower
  distance bound of an LDPC code (quantum or classical).

For a classical (binary linear) code, only matrix `H`, the
parity-check matrix, should be specified.

For a quantum CSS code, matrix `H=Hx` and either `G=Hz` or `L=Lx`
matrices are needed.

Alternatively, a detector error model (DEM) file from `stim` can be specified
using `fdem=[str]`. This file contains both detector and logical error
associations, which are used to reconstruct `Hx` and `Lx` matrices.

All matrices with entries in `GF(2)` should have the same number of columns,
`n`, and obey the following orthogonality conditions: $$H_XH_Z^T=0,\ \ \ \
H_XL_Z^T=0,\ \ \ \ L_XH_Z^T=0,\ \ \ \ L_XL_Z^T=I,$$ where \f$I\f$ is an identity
matrix.  Notice that the latter identity is not required; it is sufficient that
matrices `Lx`, `Lz`, and the product \f$L_XL_Z^T\f$ have the same full row rank
\f$k\f$, which is also the dimension of the code (number of encoded qubits).


## How it works: RW algorithm (method=1)

Given the error model, i.e., the matrices \f$H=H_x\f$, \f$L=L_x\f$ (\f$L\f$ is empty
for a classical code), the program searches for smallest-weight binary
`codewords` \f$c\f$ such that \f$Hc=0\f$, \f$Lc\neq0\f$.


It repeatedly calculates reduced row echelon form of `H`, with columns
taken in random order, which uniquely fixes the information set
(non-pivot columns).  Generally, column permutation and row reduction
gives \f$H=U\,(I|A)\,P\f$, where \f$U\f$ is invertible, \f$P\f$ is a permutation
matrix, \f$I\f$ is the identity matrix of size given by the rank of \f$H\f$,
and columns of \f$A\f$ form the information set of the corresponding
binary code.  The corresponding codewords can be drawn as the rows of
the matrix \f$(A^T|I')\,P\f$.  Because of the identity matrix \f$I'\f$, the
distribution of such vectors is tilted toward smaller weight, which
qualitatively explains why it works.

To speed up the distance calculation, you can use the parameter `wmin`
(by default, `wmin=1`).  When non-zero, if a code word of weight `w`
\f$\le\f$ `wmin` is found, the distance calculation is terminated
immediately, and the result `-w` with a negative sign is returned.
This is useful, e.g., if we need to construct a code with big enough
distance.

Additional command-line parameters relevant for this method: 

- `steps` the number of RW decoding steps (the number of information
  sets to be constructed).

## How it works: CC algorithm (method=2).

The program tries to construct a codeword recursively, by starting
with a non-zero bit in a position `i` in the range from \f$0\f$ to \f$n-1\f$,
where \f$n\f$ is the number of columns, and then recursively adding the
additional bits in the support of unsatisfied checks starting from the
top.  The complexity to enumerate all codewords of weight up to \f$w\f$
can be estimated as \f$n\,(\Delta-1)^{w-1}\f$, where \f$\Delta\f$ is the
maximum row weight.

Additional command-line parameters relevant for this method: 

- `wmax` the maximum size of the connected cluster.

- `start` the position to start the cluster.  In this case only one
  starting position `i=start` will be used.  This is useful, e.g., if
  the code is symmetric (as, e.g., for cyclic codes).

- `noscan` if set to 1, start the recursion directly with `w=wmax`,
  without scanning smaller weights.  Only works with `method=2`.
  
With `debug&2` non-zero, the program in this mode also displays the minimum
weight of the syndrome found for each error weight `w`.  Example (run from
`dist-m4ri/src/`)

```sh
./dist_m4ri debug=3 finH= ../examples/c204H.mmx method=2 wmax=10
# read H <- file '../examples/c204H.mmx'
# recursively searching for w=1 codewords wmax=10 beg=0 end=194
# recursively searching for w=2 codewords wmax=10 beg=0 end=194
# recursively searching for w=3 codewords wmax=10 beg=0 end=194
# recursively searching for w=4 codewords wmax=10 beg=0 end=194
# recursively searching for w=5 codewords wmax=10 beg=0 end=194
# recursively searching for w=6 codewords wmax=10 beg=0 end=194
# recursively searching for w=7 codewords wmax=10 beg=0 end=194
# recursively searching for w=8 codewords wmax=10 beg=0 end=194
# w=1 min syndrome weight 2
# w=2 min syndrome weight 3
# w=3 min syndrome weight 3
# w=4 min syndrome weight 2
# w=5 min syndrome weight 1
# w=6 min syndrome weight 1
# w=7 min syndrome weight 1
# w=8 min syndrome weight 0
### Cluster (actual min-weight codeword found): dmin=8
success  (found min-weight codeword) d=8

```
